## Introduction 
I am pursuing an MS in Business Analytics at David Eccles School of Business, University of Utah.
This is a repository that I have created to track my individual work in the Final Capstone Project(collaborated with Maverick) conducted together with my teammates.

## Business Problem and Project Objective :
Accurate Sales Forecasting for New Stores: Maverik needs precise sales predictions for new store planning and evaluation. Daily Sales Forecast: The project aims to provide daily sales forecasts for operational planning. Adjustment for Past Performance: The model must adjust daily forecasts based on historical data.
The project's primary goal is to create a forecasting solution for accurately predicting sales at new Maverik stores during their first year of operation, focusing on Inside Sales, Food Service, Diesel, and Unleaded Gasoline segments. Additionally, it aims to improve daily sales forecasts by incorporating past performance data.

## Solution to the Business Problem : 
We suggest an integrated solution by leveraging XGBoost for superior sales predictions, integrating with time series modeling to address seasonality. Implementing feature importance analysis for optimization and gradually replacing predicted data with actual sales will enhance accuracy. Regular model evaluations, communication, and documentation would ensure ongoing alignment with business objectives.

## My contribution to the Project :
Within our sales forecasting project, I helped with the Time Series Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), meticulously unraveling intricate patterns and nuances inherent to the inside sales, food services, diesel, and unleaded sales segments. I also applied forecasting models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet to provide predictions for future trends.

## Business Value :
By leveraging advanced predictive analytics, we aim to accurately forecast annual and daily sales within a 25% margin of actual performance across key sales segments, even before a store's opening. This system ensures a dynamic improvement in predictions throughout the year as real sales segments, even before a store's opening. This system ensures a dynamic improvement in predictions throughout the year as real sales data becomes available, allowing for constant refinement and optimization. Additionally, our commitment extends to providing high businesses to enhance store performance effectively. Ultimately, this data-driven approach empowers informed decision-making, enhances operational efficiency, and maximizes overall business value.

## Difficulties faced : 
Our project encountered notable challenges. Firstly, the impact of holidays posed a significant challenge, introducing variability that required careful consideration to ensure accurate predictions. Secondly, a small sample size posed issues, necessitating robust methodologies to mitigate potential biases and uncertainties. Additionally, excluding one out of the five types of stores posed a limitation, potentially impacting the generalizability of the findings. Addressing these challenges is crucial for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of our analysis. 

## Learnings from this project : 
I learned a lot from this project. I learned the importance of data collection and validation, model selection, results interpretation, and teamwork. I learned how to collect data from various sources, validate data for errors and inconsistencies, select the best model for a particular dataset, interpret the results of time series predictive models, and work effectively as a team. 
The skills I learned from this project will be valuable in my future career. I am interested in a career in data science, and the skills I learned in this project will help me succeed. I can use these skills to collect, validate, analyze, and interpret data to solve real-world problems. I am also grateful for the opportunity to have worked with a great team on this project. We all worked hard and learned a lot from each other.
