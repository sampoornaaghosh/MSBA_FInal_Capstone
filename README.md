## Business Problem and Project Objective :
Accurate Sales Forecasting for New Stores: Maverik needs precise sales predictions for new store planning and evaluation. Daily Sales Forecast: The project aims to provide daily sales forecasts for operational planning. Adjustment for Past Performance: The model needs to adjust daily forecasts based on historical data.
The project's primary goal is to create a forecasting solution for accurately predicting sales at new Maverik stores during their first year of operation, focusing on Inside Sales, Food Service, Diesel, and Unleaded Gasoline segments. Additionally, it aims to improve daily sales forecasts by incorporating past performance data.

## Solution to the Business Problem : 


## My contribution to the Project :
Within our sales forecasting project, I helped with the Time Series Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), meticulously unraveling intricate patterns and nuances inherent to the inside sales, food services, diesel, and unleaded sales segments. I also applied forecasting models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet to provide predictions for future trends.

## Difficulties faced :

## Learnings from this project : 
I learned a lot from this project. I learned the importance of data collection and validation, model selection, results interpretation, and teamwork. I learned how to collect data from various sources, validate data for errors and inconsistencies, select the best model for a particular dataset, interpret the results of predictive models, and work effectively as part of a team. 
The skills I learned from this project will be valuable in my future career. I am interested in a career in data science, and the skills I learned in this project will help me succeed. I can use these skills to collect, validate, analyze, and interpret data to solve real-world problems. I am also grateful for the opportunity to have worked with a great team on this project. We all worked hard and learned a lot from each other.
